<h1 class="p5"> User Documentation</h1>
<p class="p5">These artifacts highlight my profiencies at task oriented instruction and information mapping, as well as my ability to use multiple types of documentation authoring software such as MadCap Flare, Framemaker, InDesign, and Microsoft Office.</p>
		<h2 class="p5">Manuals</h2>

<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/CTEManual.pdf" target="_blank">CTE Registration System Manual [pdf]</a> The Instructional Design Unit and the Center for Teaching Excellence worked in the same office at SPSU. Because my boss has background in information technology, when the CTE needed a new registration system she took on the project. Outside consultants developed the system using a list of requirements written by another student assistant. I wrote the manual entirely on my own. This 57 page user manual covers every possible task for every role in the system. I designed this document using InDesign. Spring 2013</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/MiniClockCam.pdf" target="_blank">Mini Clock Cam [pdf]</a> The Mini Clock Cam is a portable alarm clock with a hidden camera inside. I rewrote the manual in Microsoft Word to address poor readability and document design. I designed the layout so that the manual could fit in the small rectangular box. Mini Gadgets, Spring 2012</p>
		
<p class="p5"><a href="images/DoorSpy.png" target= "blank">DoorSpy Manual [png]</a> The DoorSpy is an entry detection device that notifies users when the door it is to attached is opened. I rewrote the manual in Microsoft Word to address poor readability and document design. I designed the layout so that the manual could fit in the small rectangular box. Mini Gadgets, Spring 2012</p>
		
<!--<p class="p5"><a href="MyHtmlHelp.chm">Extruder Documentation Project [chm]</a> 
		This Microsoft Help file was created in MadCap Flare.  It instructs users how to build a RepRap Mendel Prusa Extruder.  RepRap Mendel Prusa is a kind of 3D printer used in desktop manufacturing and the extruder is the part that heats up and forms shapes with the plastic. Online Documentation, Spring 2012</p>

<!--<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/refcard.pdf" target="_blank">Reference Card [pdf]</a> This reference card was composed in Framemaker.  I shortened a reference card I made for the Instructional Design Unit to make this card that could be made into two laminated 8 1/2" by 11" cards.  This card can help faculty quickly find tools during the workshops they take to learn how to use the Desire2Learn learning management system.  User Documentation, Fall 2012</p>

<h2 class="p5">Information Mapping</h2>
		
		<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/ManualProject2.pdf" target="_blank">Information Mapping Project [pdf]</a>In this document, I have taken content from the Georgia Department of Drivers’ Services Drivers Manual and organized it into Information Maps.  I redid most of the graphics, but some of the text is the same, as the purpose of this exercise was to learn the formatting prescribed by Information Mapping. User Documentation, Fall 2012</p>
		<!--<p style="p5"><a href="#" target="_blank">ADDIE Process Map [pdf]</a>This is a process map composed in Microsoft Word for ADDIE, the process of Instructional Design. User Documentation, Fall 2012</p> 
//-->		
		
		<!--<h2 class="p5">Supporting Documentation</h2>
	
		
<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/RepRapDev.pdf" target="_blank">Rep Rap Developer Audience Analysis [pdf]</a> This is the Audience Analysis conducted to determine what information to include in the Extruder Documentation Project. Composed in Microsoft Word.  Online Documentation, Spring 2012</p>
		
<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/CLGBALRM.pdf" target="_blank">CLGBALRM [pdf]</a> I rewrote two chapters of this manual from Mini Gadgets for my User Documentation class. The Table of Contents was adjusted so that the hypothetical final document would be easier navigate. User Documentation, Fall 2012</p> //
