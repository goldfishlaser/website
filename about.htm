<h3 class="p5">Professional History</h3>
<p class="p5">My first full-time writing job was at Mini Gadgets, Inc. a wholesaler of spy gadgets and surveillence equipment. Working at a business of less than 20 employees, I was free to perform both the roles of writer and sales associate. The products we sold were manufactured in China, and many of the descriptions and instructions were in computer-translated English. This made them difficult for the customer to understand and read. Each day, I would consult with the technical support team about any of my questions regarding the function or purpose of the device and rewrite the materials. I enjoyed being able to apply my dedication and ability to learn and problem solve to the needs of a business experiencing the 
benefits and drawbacks of expansion and new opportunities. That is my favorite environment in which to work.</p>
	
<p class="p5">As an assistant instructional designer at SPSU, I learned how instructional design philosophies are applied in higher education to help people learn what they need to. I worked together with 
multiple teams of people of diverse educational and cultural backgrounds on multi-stage projects. These projects included developing help materials for the learning management software (LMS) Desire2Learn, testing and developing a user manual for a new registration system, and writing material for a set of job aids for online/blended learning instructors called the Course Design Deck. I also wrote the Instructional Design Unit Style Guide in my own free time.</p>

<p class="p5">My career goal is to become a technical writer, information designer, or proposal writer for a software company, private space exploration company, or medical technology facility. </p>


<h3 class="p5">Outside of Work</h3>
<p class="p5">In my free time, I'm interested in the philosophy of artificial (engineered) intelligence, intelligence amplification (see Howard Reingold's various publications), 
futurism (lesswrong.org style), humanism, virtual reality, philosophy of science, decision theory, epistemology, interactive 
fiction, literature, genius, Internet and hacker culture, bayesianism, systems theory, consciousness, global issues, rapid prototyping (building a RepRap), and DIY.  My interest in technology is tempered by my consciousness of ethical issues, and I am a firm advocate of Snow's third culture which cautions us against keeping the literary and scientific folk separate in academia.  I care a lot about issues surrounding privacy, self-determination, human flourishing, space travel, and globalization.   I also like to boulder (a sport where you climb rocks), play the clarinet, and do the occasional portrait with pencil or pastels.  Click the thumbnails below to check them out. </p>
