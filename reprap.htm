	  <h2 class="p5">Prusa Mendel RepRap</h2>
<p class="p5">A RepRap is a kind of additive manufacturing machine also known as a 3D printer. Additive manufacturing just means that parts are made my building up the material, instead of cutting into a block of material. The goal of RepRaps are to be machines that rapidly reproduce themselves, mirroring the processes of biology. This is why they are often named after famous biologists. The kind of RepRap I have is called "Prusa Mendel" or "Prusa" for short. I have been interested in Free Libre and Open Source Software since high school, and I believe I first learned about RepRaps at the LessWrong online community. The hacker philosophy has always been interesting and exciting to me, and I am happy that DIY "Maker" culture seems to be spreading like wildfire.<p>
<p class="p5"><img src="images/repglam.jpg" align="right"; height="227"; width="185";>I bought the mostly assembled machine from someone online a few years ago. I could only work on the machine in spurts, because I was also trying to work and get my degree. My only prior experience with a project like this was the science fair project I did in high school, which involved a little bit of circuit construction and C programming. I taught myself quite a bit and made some progress, but I soon realised that I needed to get help from someone more experienced. So I went to Freeside and met Ben Morgan, who helped me not only complete the build, but upgrade it so that it functions better.</p> 
	<p class="p5">My machine uses RepRap v 1.4 electronics and Nema 17 stepper motors. The bed is slightly larger than most Prusas. Every axis slides on linear bearings, rather than directly on the plastic parts. To make changes to the firmware, I use Sprinter. To turn STL files into G-code, I use Slic3r. Finally, to print an object, I use Pronterface.</p>
