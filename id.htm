		<h1 class="p5">Instructional Design</h1>
		<p class="p5">During my senior year at Southern Polytechnic State Univeristy I was fortunate enough to gain the position of Assistant Instructional Designer in the Office of Faculty Support and Development. My tasks were to help the Instructional Design team develop materials for professors of online learning and hybrid courses that ensured they were able to use the Desire2Learn LMS to teach their courses to University standards. </p>
					<h2 class="p5">Instructional Materials</h2>
	<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/CTERS.pptx" target="_blank"> CTE Registration System Training PowerPoints [ppt]</a> The Instructional Design Unit and the Center for Teaching Excellence worked in the same office at SPSU. Because my boss has background in information technology, when the CTE needed a new registration system she took on the project. Outside consultants developed the system using a list of requirements written by another student assistant. Another student assistant and myself were responsible for testing the product against these requirements, and determine how the system works. With the information from my testing, I developed two training PowerPoint presentations to be delivered by an instructional designer to the administrators of the new system. This is the first one. Instructional Design Unit, Spring 2013 </p> 
<p class="p5"><a href="http://www.spsu.edu/instructionaldesignsupport/id/cdd.htm" target="_blank">Course Design Deck Job Aid [external link]</a> I worked with a team of students assistants to create this deck of cards targeted to faculty members teaching online or blended learning courses. Each card defines a concept, provides examples and applications, and recommends further external scholarly readings. I wrote many, though not all, of the cards, but was involved in editing all of the cards and being the final check before the cards were reviewed by the Instructional Designers. Instructional Design Unit, Fall 2013</p>

<p class="p5"><a href="http://spsu.edu/instructionaldesign/d2l/" target="_blank">Desire2Learn Faculty Support [external link]</a> I was heavily involved in the project management and creation of the Desire2Learn Faculty Support self-help materials. I worked with a team of student assistants to update the handouts we created last year for Desire2Learn v9 to the new version Desire2Learn v 10.2. We all were involved together in taking new screenshots, editing the steps, and ensuring adherence to the updated Instructional Design Unit Study Guide. I was responsible for the final check before materials were reviewed by the Instructional Designers.  Instructional Design Unit Fall 2013

Handout [pdf]</a> This artifact was composed in PowerPoint during my position as Assistant Instructional Designer in the Instructional Design Unit at SPSU as part of the materials created to teach faculty how to use the Content tool.

	<p class="p5"><a href="pdfs/RespondusCheatSheet.docx" target="_blank">Respondus Reference Sheet [docx]</a> This reference sheet was composed in Microsoft Word.  It was handed out to faculty members taking the TADL course as a job aid.  <br>Instructional Design Unit, Spring 2013</p>

		<a href="Apache Web Development.apkg" target="_blank">Anki Flashcard Deck [apkg]</a> This flash card deck created in Anki was developed for my own personal use studying Apache Web development. Questions come from primarily from the first chapter of <i>Apache, MySQL, and PHP Web Developent for Dummies</i> by Jeff Cogswell. This flash card deck demonstrates that I am aware of the benefit of flash cards for learning and can create a deck of cards to help users learn.<br><i><b>NOTE:</b> you will need <a href="http://ankisrs.net/" target ="_blank">Anki software</a> to view this artifact.</i></p>
