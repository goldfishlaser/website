                <div class = "intro">Is anyone a self taught artist? It is probably easier to say these days, but in reality, most of us have learned something from someone. Practice is what brings anything to fruition, so in that sense, even those who study under others are self taught. I am a bit unsure of who has taught me what. I had some art classes when I was younger, I've watched some Bob Ross, and I had an art class in middle school. Beyond that, though, I have had the vast resources of the internet to help me learn some skills here and there. Yet, I think as far as the art world would be concerned, I'm a self-taught amateur artist. </div>

                <h1>Aerial Silks</h1>
                <div class = "intro">I have taken dance classes since I was young.  I took classes in ballet, tap, and jazz. Didn't really enjoy myself at the time, but perhaps I would have if I could have seen how I might apply those skills in more fun (to me) forms of dance. I enjoyed myself more when I took clogging in middleschool. I only remember the most basic moves of clogging, but it is enough to give me something to do with my feet when Bad Moon Rising comes on. Then, I went through a phase where I was doing swing dancing and lindy hop. That was a lot of fun too, and I hope to find time for it again soon. But when I found aerial silks and other aerial disciplines, I found my home. I have been studying aerial dance for about 6 years. </div>
