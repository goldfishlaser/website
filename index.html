		<div class="intro"><p>Welcome to my Web portfolio. On this page you can find examples of professional and personal work that I have chosen to display my skills, interests, and personality. This site is also an example of my work as it is also coded by yours truly. My professional work samples can be found in the <a href="/tcom.htm"><b>Technical and Professional Writing</b></a> category. However, a person is more than what they do in the office, so I invite you to also take a look at some of the other categories to learn more about me.</p>
		<p>I have worked professionally as a Technical Writer since July 2012 (~8 years) in a variety of environments. I graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in Technical Communication with a concentration in Information Design from Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU). As a capstone project for that class, I created a web portfolio that you can view <a href="http://melanieallen.nfshost.com/oldwebsite/">here</a>. However, in today's mobile world, I needed to make sure you could view my portfolio on any device, and so I discontinued updating my old one and created this one with modern responsive patterns. This is a work in progress. </p>
		<p>My objective is to apply my technical writing, graphic design, web development, and information design skills in a high energy environment that values professional excellence and providing clients an exceptional experience.
		If you like what you see from my work samples, please contact me or add me on LinkedIn to connect. My resume is also available below.</p></div>
